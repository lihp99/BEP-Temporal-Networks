# BEP Temporal Networks
 An empirical study on temporal networks conducted by Philipp Liehe

## Usage
The files corresponding to each of the two data sets investigated contain a Jupyter notebook that can be used to reproduce all findings from the project, .zip files of the original data, which needs to be unzipped to be used with the provided code and pickle files containing all networks and subnetworks used in this project.

### DATA FOR THE SMMnet network
The .csv files to use the SMMnet network code are too big to be uploaded on GitHub and can hence be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leomauro/smmnet/
